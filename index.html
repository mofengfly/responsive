        <h3>Toggle Navigation</h3>

<p>From Responsive Navigation Patterns:</p>

<p>For small screens a “menu” button appears that, when clicked, expands an accordion style navigation. When more screen real estate becomes available</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<p>Keeps the user in place- Where the footer anchor jumps suddenly, the toggle menu simply appears in place, which doesn’t disorient the user.
Elegant- This is definitely one of the more classy approaches. No awkward forms or page jumps, just a smooth animated flyout or basic show/hide.
Easy to scale up- All you need to do is hide the mobile trigger and show the nav list when the appropriate breakpoint is reached and you have yourself a normal large screen nav. All this can be accomplished with CSS.</p>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<p>Animation performance- Your mileage will vary when doing any sort of animation on mobile devices. Android is notoriously bad with CSS animations and so things might not be as smooth as you’d like. Also, for what it’s worth I’ve recently been animating max-height which seems to work well.
Javascript dependency- Again this approach relies on a bit of Javascript in order to trigger the toggle, but it’s minimal. I have one Blackberry test device that refuses to listen to any of this stuff, but most browsers, including proxy browsers like Opera Mini and Dolphin Mini, handle it just fine.</p>

<h3>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
